# MNIST Autoencoder Visualizations 03

This is a project I did in September 2022. Some of the results can be seen below.

This image shows the final frame of the animation. Basically I just did a slow blend between this image and its transpose.

## MP4s

grid_blend.mp4 is an older result, where some randome numbers blend to other random numbers.

sorted_grid_blend.mp4 is the result of blending each number to each other number in a grid.
