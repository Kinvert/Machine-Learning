# tinygrad MNIST Autoencoder Training History

This autoencoder was made with tinygrad.

The first image here is a gif showing the training history of a single digit. In this case you can see that as training progressed, the digit became more clear. In this case it was a seven.

The second image shows basically the same animation as above, except rather than animating it, the frames are arranged in a tiled image. This was a different digit, in this case a 6.
