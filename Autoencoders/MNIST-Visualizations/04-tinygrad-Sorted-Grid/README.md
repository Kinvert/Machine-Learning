# tinygrad MNIST Autoencoder Latent Space Walk

This autoencoder was made with tinygrad.

This first image is showing a latent space walk between each number to each other in a grid. Unfortunately this 8 doesn't look very good. I didn't train the network long on this to get all the numbers looking great.

This second is the unsorted version. Just a latent space walk from one image in the training set to the next.

There are also some videos but they don't show well in here. They're much smaller than the gifs.
