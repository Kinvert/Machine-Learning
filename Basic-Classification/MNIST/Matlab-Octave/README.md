# MNIST Using Matlab-Octave

Doing some basic classification on MNIST

## Brief Video Description

I did this in a night trying to use OpenAI's ChatGPT but ultimately I gave up and did it on my own. There were a couple somewhat useful snippets but they all needed changing. For example, the gradients were going in the wrong direction and making it diverge instead of converge. But after digging around and finding the problem, it was just down to flipping the sign.

This YouTube video is just a brief intro to the project.
