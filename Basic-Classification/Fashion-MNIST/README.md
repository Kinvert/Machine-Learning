## CHALLENGE - Only Copy/Paste From OpenAI ChatGPT

I did some of these purely using copy and paste from OpenAI's ChatGPT. It took some nudging, but it got fairly good results.

In my case I was talking to it as an experienced coder would, talking about things like validation accuracy etc. Directly mentioning errors and asking it to fix them. Stuff like that.
