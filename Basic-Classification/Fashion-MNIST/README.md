Doing some basic classification on Fashion-MNIST

## OpenAI ChatGPT

I did some of these purely using copy and paste from OpenAI's ChatGPT. It took some nudging, but it got fairly good results.

For now I still doubt it could do great with someone brand new to coding.

But honestly, even if they just paste in error messages, I think it can get 85% accuracy.

In my case I was talking to it as an experienced coder would, talking about things like validation accuracy etc.
