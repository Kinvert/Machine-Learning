Doing some basic classification on Fashion-MNIST

## CHALLENGE - Only Copy/Paste From OpenAI ChatGPT

I did some of these purely using copy and paste from OpenAI's ChatGPT. It took some nudging, but it got fairly good results.

To continue to improve results, you do have to be very hands on.

In my case I was talking to it as an experienced coder would, talking about things like validation accuracy etc. Directly mentioning errors and asking it to fix them. Stuff like that.
