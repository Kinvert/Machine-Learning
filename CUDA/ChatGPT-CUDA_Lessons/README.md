**Keith: We are going to create a series of lessons together, teaching students CUDA in C++. These lessons will go all the way from Installation, to Hello World, to Vector Addition etc, and several other intermediate topics, all the way up to solving MNIST with CUDA and C++.**

**Can you please write out the introduction and outline for this CUDA Course? It will go in the README.md file.**

Certainly! Here is the introduction and outline for the CUDA course:

## Introduction to CUDA C++

CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) is a parallel computing platform and application programming interface (API) developed by NVIDIA. It allows developers to leverage the power of NVIDIA GPUs to accelerate their applications and perform complex computations faster.

In this course, we will learn how to write and execute CUDA C++ programs to accelerate our applications using the power of NVIDIA GPUs. We will start with the basics, such as installation and setting up the development environment, and gradually move on to more advanced topics, such as memory management and performance optimization.

## Outline
- Installation and Setting up the Development Environment
  - Install the NVIDIA GPU drivers
  - Install the CUDA Toolkit
  - Install the cuDNN library (optional)
  - Verify the installation
- **Hello World**
  - Write and execute our first CUDA C++ program
  - Understand the structure of a CUDA C++ program
  - Learn about the host and device functions
- **Memory Management**
  - Allocate and transfer data between host and device memory
  - Understand the different types of memory in CUDA
- **Vector Addition**
  - Write a CUDA C++ program to perform vector addition on the GPU
  - Understand the concept of parallelism in CUDA
- **Intermediate Topics**
  - Learn about thread hierarchy and thread cooperation
  - Understand the concept of shared memory
  - Learn how to optimize kernel launch configurations
- **Solving MNIST with CUDA C++**
  - Use CUDA C++ to accelerate the training of a neural network to classify images from the MNIST dataset
  - Understand how to use CUDA C++ to perform complex computations faster
  
I hope this outline gives you an idea of the scope and structure of the course. Let me know if you have any questions or if you would like to make any changes to the outline.

**Note: I will probably work with ChatGPT to expand this outline a bit. For now, this is what it spit out.**
