# Matrix Operations Introduction

Matrix operations are a fundamental part of scientific and technical computing, and are frequently used in a wide range of applications such as image and video processing, machine learning, and data analysis. Matrices are used to represent and manipulate large amounts of data, and matrix operations allow us to perform various computations on these data sets.

A matrix is a two-dimensional array of numbers, with rows and columns. Matrix operations include basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication, as well as more advanced operations such as matrix inversion and singular value decomposition. These operations are essential for solving many real-world problems and are widely used in various fields of study.

In this lesson, we will be exploring how to perform matrix operations in CUDA, a parallel computing platform and programming model developed by NVIDIA. CUDA allows us to leverage the power of modern GPUs to perform computations much faster than on a CPU alone. By using CUDA to perform matrix operations, we can achieve significant performance gains and speed up our computations.
