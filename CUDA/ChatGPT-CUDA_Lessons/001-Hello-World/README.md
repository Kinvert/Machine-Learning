## Introduction

In this code example, we will learn how to write and execute a simple kernel in CUDA C++. A kernel is a function that is executed on the GPU by many threads concurrently. We will also learn how to synchronize the host and device and how to print output from the host and device.

## The Code
Here is the code example:

```cpp
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

__global__ void hello_kernel()
{
    int i = blockIdx.x;
    printf("Hello, World from thread %d!\n", i);
}

int main()
{
    hello_kernel<<<1, 1>>>();
    cudaDeviceSynchronize();
    printf("Hello, World from the host!\n");
    return 0;
}
```
Let's go through the code line by line to understand how it works.

```cpp
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>
```

These lines include the cuda_runtime.h header file and the stdio.h header file. The cuda_runtime.h header file provides access to the CUDA runtime API, which includes functions for managing device memory, launching kernels, and synchronizing the host and device. The stdio.h header file provides access to standard input/output functions such as printf.

```cpp
__global__ void hello_kernel()
{
    int i = blockIdx.x;
    printf("Hello, World from thread %d!\n", i);
}
```

This is the definition of the hello_kernel kernel. The kernel is a function that is executed on the GPU by many threads concurrently. The __global__ keyword specifies that the function is a kernel.

The kernel takes no arguments. Inside the kernel, the blockIdx.x variable holds the block index within the grid, and the threadIdx.x variable holds the thread index within the block. In this example, we are using a single block of threads, so the blockIdx.x variable is equal to 0.

The kernel prints a message that includes the thread index.

```cpp
int main()
{
    hello_kernel<<<1, 1>>>();
    cudaDeviceSynchronize();
    printf("Hello, World from the host!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

The main function is the entry point of the program. It contains the code that is executed on the host.

The first line of the main function launches the hello_kernel kernel with a single block of threads. The <<<1, 1>>> syntax specifies the grid of thread blocks and the number of threads per block. In this example, we are using a single block of threads with a single thread.

The second line of the main function synchronizes the host and device using the cudaDeviceSynchronize function. This function waits until all the kernels launched on the device have completed.

The third line of the main function prints a message from the host.

The final line of the main function returns 0 to indicate that the program has completed successfully.

## Output

Here is the output of the code example:

```cpp
Hello, World from thread 0!
Hello, World from the host!
```
The kernel prints a message that includes the thread index, and the main function prints a message from the host.

## Conclusion

In this code example, we learned how to write and execute a simple kernel in CUDA C++, how to synchronize the host and device, and how to print output from the host and device.

I hope this helps! If you have any further questions or need more information, don't hesitate to ask.
