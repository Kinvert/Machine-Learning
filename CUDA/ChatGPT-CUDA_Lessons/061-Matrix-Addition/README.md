We can start by discussing the introduction to matrix addition.

Matrix addition is a fundamental operation in linear algebra that involves adding corresponding elements in two matrices to create a new matrix. For example, given two matrices $A$ and $B$ with the same size, the matrix sum $C$ is calculated as follows:

$C_{i,j} = A_{i,j} + B_{i,j}$

where $C_{i,j}$ is the element in the $i$-th row and $j$-th column of matrix $C$, and $A_{i,j}$ and $B_{i,j}$ are the corresponding elements in matrices $A$ and $B$, respectively.

For example, given the following matrices $A$ and $B$:

${\left\lbrack \matrix{A_{1,1} & A_{1,2} \cr A_{2,1} & A_{2,2}} \right\rbrack} = {\left\lbrack \matrix{1 & 2 \cr 3 & 4} \right\rbrack}$

$B = \begin{bmatrix} 5 & 6 \\ 7 & 8 \end{bmatrix}$

The matrix sum $C$ is calculated as follows:

$C = \begin{bmatrix} 1+5 & 2+6 \\ 3+7 & 4+8 \end{bmatrix}$

Which results in the following matrix $C$:

$C = \begin{bmatrix} 6 & 8 \\ 10 & 12 \end{bmatrix}$

Matrix addition is an important operation that is used in many applications, including image processing, machine learning, and scientific computing. In this lesson, we will learn how to perform matrix addition using C++ and the CUDA programming platform.
